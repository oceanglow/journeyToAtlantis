SSH – Secure SHell:
A protocol. Uses encryption to secure the connection between a client and a server. All user authentication, commands, output, and file transfers are encrypted to protect against attacks in the network.

PuTTy implements SSH, and is a SSH Client for Windows and Linux.

The protocol is used in corporate networks for:
•	Providing secure access for users and automated processes
•	Interactive and automated file transfers
•	Issuing remote commands
•	Managing network infrastructure and other mission-critical system components.

SSH keys
SSH keys always come in pairs, and each pair is made up of a private key and a public key. Who or what possesses these keys determines the type of SSH key pair. 
If the private key and the public key remain with the user, this set of SSH keys is referred to as user keys. 
If the private and public key are on a remote system, then this key pair is referred to as host keys. 
Another type of SSH key is a session key. When a large amount of data is being transmitted, session keys are used to encrypt this information.  

User key:
In a user key set, the private key remains on the system being used to access the remote system and is used to decrypt information that is exchanged in the SSH protocol. Private keys should never be shared with anyone. 
A public key is used to encrypt information, can be shared, and is used by the user and the remote server. On the server end, the public key is saved in a file that contains a list of authorized public keys. On the user’s side, the public SSH key is stored in an SSH key management software or in a file on their computer.
