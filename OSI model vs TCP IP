PART 1: Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model
A conceptual framework that describes the functions of a networking or telecommunication system. 

Short summary: 
7. Application Apps that users interact with directly. Etc. Google Chrome 
Protocol examples: HTTP, FTP, DHCP, IRC 

6. Presentation Translation of application format <-> network format. Etc. Encryption & decryption of data for secure transmission. 
Protocol exauples: TSL, IPSec, ASCII 

5. Session Setup, coordinate & termination of sessions (for computers or servers to speak to one another). 
Protocol examples: NFS, RPC, 5M8, SOCKS 

4. Transport - Coordination of data transfer btw systems & hosts [how much to send, rate, location]. 
protocol examples: TCP, UDP, AH, DCCP, use port number 

3. Network - Packet forwarding, routing through different routers. Etc IP addresses 
protocol examples: IP, IPX, AppleTalk 

2. Data link - Node-to-node (directly connected) data transfer. Etc. Media Access Control (MAC) and Logical Link control (LLC). 
protocol exauples: LLDP, PPP, CDP, VLAN, IEEE 802.11 

1. Physical Electrical & physcial representation, cable type, radio freq etc. 
protocol examples: Ethernet, USB, DSL, ISDN, IEEE 1394 

*can debug network problem if you are familiar with the 7 layers. 

PART 2: TCP/IP  
1. Application [App, presentation, session] -> HTTProtocol, DNS (Domain Name Service help to map webnane to IP address) protocol 

2. Transport -> Applications implementing the TCP & UDP protocols listen on these port numbers. 
TCP and UDP on the receiving host know which application to send the data to based on the port numbers received in the headers. 

3. Internet [Network] -> Has a view of the entire Internetwork 

4. Network access [Data link, physical] -> Limited to the physical layer boundary (etc router).
