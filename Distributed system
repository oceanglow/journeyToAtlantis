Distributed systems 
Definition: A group of computers working together as to appear as a single computer to the end user. 
--> they'll have shared state, operate concurrently and can fail independently without affecting the whole system's uptime. 
Example: Distributed databae system [our database runs on multiple machines at the same time, *how??] -> user can insert a record into node#1 and node#3 must be able to return that record -> the nodes communicate to each other to coordinate their actions. 

It is scaling horizontally, to handle more traffic/ increase fault tolerance and reduce latency. 
Allow you to have a node in both cities, allowing traffic to hit the node that is closest to it. 
Adding more computers than'upgrading the hardware of existing one. 

How does it works? 
1. 1 master [main place where you update], multiple slaves [sync with master, you read from this]. Limited as time is needed to sync with master, and after all master is only 1 machine. 
2. Multiple masters replication: Multip1e masters that support both write and read. Prone to conflicts when you insert 2 records with same ID. 
3. Sharding: split your main master server into smaller multiple servers, with each one storing different stuff. Very inefficient as queries will need to go through all the shards. 

Distributed applications: etc BitTorrent [leacher and seeder], Blockchain

"8 Fallacies", the 8 assumptions of a distributed system: 
The network is reliable. 
Latency is zero. 
Bandwidth is infinite. 
The network is secure. 
Topology doesn't change. 
There is one administrator. 
Transport cost is zero. 
The network is homogeneous. 

Latency: the time between initiating a request for data and the beginning of the actual data transfer. Bandwidth: A measure of the capacity of a communications channel. The higher a channel's bandwidth, the more information it can carry. 

Topology: The different configurations that can be adopted in building networks, such as a ring, bus, star or meshed. 

Homogeneous network: A network running a single network protocol

IP suite
The Internet protocol suite provides end-to-end data communication specifying how data should be packetized, addressed, transmitted, routed, and received. 
This functionality is organized into four abstraction layers, which classify all related protocols according to the scope of networking involved. 

Each layer having the property that it only uses the functions of the layer below, and only exports functionality to the layer above. 
From lowest to highest, the layers: 
A. Link layer, containing communication methods for data that remains within a single network segment (link) -physical transmission of data. over the physical network. 
B. Internet/ Network layer, providing internetworking between independent networks 
C. Transport layer, handling host-to-host communication [either TCP or UDP]
